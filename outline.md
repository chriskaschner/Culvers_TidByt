- using a selected culvers locations, but that can be changed
- here's my first preferred location: https://www.culvers.com/restaurants/mt-horeb
- future state, change the tracked culvers based on calendar settings or the weather, aka "when i can ski, I go to Mt-Horeb, when I bike I like Todd Dr"
- current flavor of the day is "Andes Mint Avalanche"
- find the upcoming flavor calendar for the month, fall back to 5 days if the month isn't available
- upcoming calendar (5 days) is here: https://www.culvers.com/restaurants/mt-horeb#view-calendar
- full month is here: https://www.culvers.com/restaurants/mt-horeb%23view-calendar?tab=current
- check to make sure at least the next 5 days are available, I'm concerned about edge cases at the end of the month
- pull that calendar and genearate events in a google calendar
- update the google calendar when things change
- a calandar event should have an ice cream emoji (🍦) and then the name of the flavor of the day
- the body of the calendar event should include the descripton from culvers
- I'd like the url of the flavor calendar for the selected restaurant either in the location or the body as well of the calendar invite
- here's the link for the current flavor of the day: https://www.culvers.com/flavor-of-the-day/andes-mint-avalanche
- here's the description: "Andes Candies and novelty chocolate with our specially blended Mint Fresh Frozen Custard."
- I'm going to use this calendar in google calendar and I'd like to have it dynamically updated, recommend a method to keep it up to date.
- I'd also like to create a Tidbyt app to display this on a tidbyt screen: https://tidbyt.com/pages/apps#create
- here's an app style that I think would fit well: https://github.com/tidbyt/community/tree/main/apps/nws_live_forecast
- the tidbyt app should display the upcoming flavor of the day and use a different pixel specific icon for each flavor (mint ice cream should use green, vanilla should be white, etc.)
- tidbyt users should be able to adjust their local culvers to whatever restaurant they prefer.
- some verification should happen so you can only select an existing Culver's
- 3 day forecast:
- 5 pixel height title, location name "Todd Dr"
- 3 images - cone with color and dots on ice cream representing color (ex, Andes Mint Avalanch is green ice cream with black dots)
- shortened version of name in order to read name underneath cone image, should be in same space as the temp in the NWS life forecast example app
